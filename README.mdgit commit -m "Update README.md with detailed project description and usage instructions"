# Multitask-Movie-Recommendation-System

## Overview
This repository hosts the implementation of a multitask learning approach for movie recommendations as part of the XCS330 course at Stanford University. The project investigates the impact of parameter sharing between different tasks within a movie recommendation model to enhance recommendation quality.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of separate models against models with shared parameters under different configurations of factorization and regularization parameters. We implement and evaluate models based on matrix factorization and neural collaborative filtering techniques to predict user-movie interactions.

## Experimental Setup
The experiments focus on two main configurations:

- Lambda F = 0.99 and Lambda R = 0.01: Evaluates the impact of high regularization on model performance, particularly how it affects overfitting and generalization across tasks.
- Lambda F = 0.5 and Lambda R = 0.5: Examines a balanced approach to factorization and regularization to assess overall performance.

## Results
Experimental results demonstrate:

- Models without parameter sharing generally perform better on both training and test datasets, indicating possible overfitting when parameters are shared.
- The balanced approach (Lambda F = 0.5 and Lambda R = 0.5) tends to generalize better on unseen data, suggesting its effectiveness in managing overfitting compared to highly skewed regularization settings.
